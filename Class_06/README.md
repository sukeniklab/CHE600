# CHEM260 F23 Class 4

Today's class will focus on finishing the tasks from Tuesday, and then setting up a python environment for us to work in for the remainder of class! We have two options we can use:

* [Serverside python] (Using the ```awk``` command)
* [Local python] (Using nested for loops with ```sed```)

In either case, we will be able to work on classroom computers or on our own laptop. The first thing we need is to download and install [miniconda] - conda is an "environment manager" - basically a program that lets us load a range of libraries locally and temporarily to run code. Once we're done running, we can revert to our normal (base) environment.

1. Download miniconda from:

2. Install
